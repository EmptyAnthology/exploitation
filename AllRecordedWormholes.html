  <p class="thing2">I have tried before to write down every single illegal item featured in all kits and wormhole barrels, 
    but gave up after finishing the first and second generation of the wormhole. I in here want to atleast give a short description
    of the most interesting kits I have found so that people looking for specific kits can find them more easily.
  </p>
    <br>
    <p class="thing2">The Wormhole Barrel - First Generation: The one that started it all. Made by SpokeIsHere and ashswagg, it contains
      iconic items like the Hyperion, Speed Boots or Walter Hartwell White as well the DEATH potion killing unkillable things by the usage
      of the integer overflow of Health Points.
    </p>
    <p class="thing2">The Wormhole Barrel - Second Generation: My debut in the Exploiting Community. It was really rough and focused
      mainly on putting as many NBT items as possible into a NBT barrel which resulted in me getting chunkbanned on our SMP ◑﹏◐
      </p>
    <p class="thing2">Black Clover: Learning from my mistakes of Gen2, I shot for minimalism. I created the Black Clover
      Kit consisting of five shulkers each aiming on a different type of items. I made Sangonomiya for Command Items and Weapons, Sin for 
      special spawn eggs, Destruction for bombs, Exploitation for pre-filled Command Blocks and Mikaela (or Mikaera using the japanese original)
      for all the stuff that fit nowhere else. This had much more success, but I never really used it due to reasons explained in "The Wormhole Diary".
    </p>
    <p class="thing2">Finnle24's Wormhole: This is a wormhole my friend made, but I don't really get it. There are illegal items in there too,
      but it has no real point.
    </p>
    <p class="thing2">Sanskari's Kits: These kits consist of five shulkers. The MLG Kit, which just contains stacks of water buckets,
      The Stacked Totems Kit, which contains - surprise - stacked totems, The ULTIMATE Kit, which contains Illegal Armor, Weapons and Items,
      The Shit Lagger Kit, which contains game-breaking items like bombs that crash servers and The Potion Box, which contains Illegal Potions.
      The simplicity of the Kits really stuck with me and when I want a kit that is more simply, I often use Sanskari's kits.
    </p>
    <p class="thing2">Tesla's Spells v3.5: This kit was MADE for people who enjoy items that fundamentally break the game like insta-crash
      spawn eggs, containing multiple spawn eggs like these. This kit also requires no OP to use, meaning you can use any of these Items
      without OP, which is very good if you backdoored the server.
  </p>
    <p class="thing2">Tesla's Potions v3.5.1: This kit contains a huge amount of Illegal Potions, similar to Tesla's Spells. Nothing
      special, but nice to add to a collection when you have a free slot left.
  </p>
    <p class="thing2">Tesla's Unobtainables v3.5.1: The name is program. You have basic things like command blocks, uncraftable arrows
      but also funnier stuff like Petrified Oak Slabs, Book of Knowledge, End Gateway or Amethyst Buds. Fun and useful for mapbuilders,
      but nothing too practical.
  </p>
    <p class="thing2">Abuse Kit v5: This kit is the Tesla's Spells for people who enjoy command items. This Kit contains very funny things
      like a collection of Bombs and server killers, but also a Insta-Shot gun or a spawn-egg spawning a huge particle area that kills 
      anyone using health stack overflow. Needless to say, this kit is one of my favorites by a long shot. Consider also checking out 
      the Redux version.
  </p>
    <p class="thing2">"The Stores": This kit doesn't actually have a name, so this what I call it lmao. It contains seven spawn eggs that
      spawn custom villagers with custom trades. There is The Alchemist that trades vanilla potions, The Infestor that trades you the
      Infested Counterparts of the stones you give him, The Storekeeper that trades blocks and items you can't normally get like
      Invisible Item Frames, Locked Chests or the Bundle, The Collector that trades impossible Blocks like a TNT that explodes upon
      breaking it, Snowy Mycelium, half a cake or a headless piston, The Spacetime Manipulator that trades Nether Portal Blocks or End
      Portal Blocks, The Conductor that trades Impossible Entities like a Shulker Box Minecart or Glowing Minecart and the Resurrector that
      trades Spawn Eggs for Mobs or Armor Stands in specific positions. All of these traders are insanely funny and OP and have found their 
      place in almost any kit I make.
  </p>
    <p class="thing2">z32k's Backdoor Collection v1: This Kit is basically a more command-based reincarnation of the Abuse Kit v5. It
      contains NBT-prefilled command blocks and similar things for stuff like grieving or trolling. Pretty fun, but in my opinion,
      Abuse Kit v5 is still better.
  </p>
    <p class="thing2">INFINITY SHULKER made by JiffyTheBest24: While appearing like nothing special with this kit including basic stuff
      like stacked totems, pots, but the interesting thing is the armor and sword having infinite stats. Not sure if that is just edited 
      lore or actual infinite values, but it's still a cool concept.
  </p>
    <p class="thing2">Fun Mobs: The mobs are fun. Idk.
  </p>
    <p class="thing2">Infinite Shores Kit: The first kit I actually made that I would consider a kit. This kit focuses on me being
      a physics nerd with it being pretty basic stuff. I'm still new to this, don't judge.
  </p>
