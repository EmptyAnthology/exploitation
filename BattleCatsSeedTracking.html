  <h1>EmptyAnthology's Exploiting Website: Cheating in Battle Cats - Seed Tracking</h1>
  </center>
  <br>
  
  <p class="thing2">"Battle Cats" by PONOS is, in my opinion, the best mobile video game ever made. On the surface, it's a simple
    tower defense game where your task is to colonise the whole universe using an assortment of Cats that have special abilities to
    defeat your opponents which are other animals. For these reasons and more, Battle Cats has been a phenomenal success with more than
    10 million downloads and over half a million ratings with a total of 4.5 stars. But of course, each video game that is mildly successful
    has it's fair share of exploits and glitches. And within Battle Cats, this exploit just happens to be one of the most interesting
    I have found up to date.
  </p>
  <p class="thing2">A game is considered a gacha game when it involves some sort of lootbox-based gambling system. The one in Battle Cats 
    is, in my opinion, really fair though, not advertising pay-to-win that much with no spending money being required to partake in it. 
    Still, players have always searched for ways to tweak their odds just a little bit, but the coolest thing about this exploit is that
    it isn't done in the game itself: instead, it's done using math and out-of-game ressources. And it's got a fancy name too: Seed Tracking.
  </p>
  <p class="thing2">In video game terms, a seed is when specific defining data for something is saved in a string of numbers. The 
    most infamous example of this would be the seed from Minecraft which saves the entire data for a whole world in a string of numbers
    not containing more than maybe 20 digits. Battle Cats utilizes the feature too to determine the gacha odds for a person rolling a lootbox.
    So one might start realizing how Seed Tracking works. The most common tool to find a seed is godfat's website which regularly has a queue of
    3000 people waiting for their seed to get calculated (as the time of writing this, the event is Epic Fest. The current queue is over 5000 people waiting).
    First, you need to roll any limited banner ten times. Then, you need to input your rolls into the ten dialog windows and then,
    you have to wait. After you are at the bottom of the queue, your seed will be neatly calculated and promtly be put out for you.
    Then, input that seed into another part of godfat's website and you'llS find a list of all your future pulls, and depending on the
    banner, what uber you will get and when you'll get it. This is extremly useful for conserving cat food and rare tickets for times
    when you will be guaranteed to get the uber you actually want.
  </p>
  <p class="thing2">So, how does this work? Sadly, I'm not sure. The formula to calculate a seed is both really complex and kept secret
    by godfat to ensure it not getting patched. But the more intricate details as well as a really detailed guide will be linked
    in the button down below.
