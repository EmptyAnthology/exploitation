  <p class="thing2">Valve is one of the biggest AAA-Studios. They are most known for making Steam, but you might also known them for their 
    games "Portal", "Half-Life", "DOTA" or "Team Fortress 2". Especially for their revolutionary game "Portal 2", an active Community
    for the game still exists after more than 10 years which includes a very healty modding community. Mods for Portal 2 which even made 
    it's way to Steam: these include "Portal Reloaded", "Portal Soties: Mel", "Portal: Revolution", "Portal: Thinking with Time Machines",
    "Aperture Tag: The Paint Gun Testing Initiative", "Portal: Forbidden Testing Tracks" as well as others. I am a big fan of the Portal
    Francise and because of my inability to play off-steam mods due to a little issue I have with Steam, I love playing these mods.
    My favorite is "Aperture Tag: The Paint Gun Testing Initiative", by the way. This will become important later.
  </p>
  <p class="thing2">What many people do not know, however, is that you are able to access the developer console in all GoldSource
    and Source games using the menu. Just enable the developer console hotkey in the "controls"-section of the menu. Then, simply type
    sv_cheats 1 and cheats will be enabled.
  </p>
  <p class="thing2">Why is this important? Last year, 2023, a new Portal 2 mod called "Portal: Forbidden Testing Track". I played this 
    mod and found myself frustrated very quickly with it's absurd and annoying puzzles and the extremly frustrating puzzles which weren't 
    difficult to solve: they were just annoying. But there was a way. I was able to skip those annoying puzzles and stages and move onto
    more fun stuff using the noclip command. I will not explain this as thoroughly, you can see my stances on cheating in games in the entry "The Cheating Morale Codex".
    But basically, one thing I often hear is that this "ruins your fun as the point of Portal is to solve this puzzles even if they are frustrating". 
    But I beg to differ. Portal, to me, is more than a simple puzzle game. You can skip the puzzles and still have fun. The unique
    humor, the beautiful story, the layers of meta-story inside the world of Portal; I play Portal for these things, not just for the puzzles.
  </p>
  <p class="thing2">If you disagree with my opinion, that is fine. But for all those who see it like me, I will now share my favorite
    commands of the developer console which will very much change up your regular playthrough as well as provide a short explanation:
  </p>
  <br>
  <p class="thing2">ent_create_portal: This command is able to create a new prop. The things I found most fun was
    "ent_create_portal_weight_box". This creates a Weighted Storage Cube and I found the challenge fun to carry this cube with me through
    the entire game.
  </p>
  <p class="thing2">buddha: This command makes it so that you can take damage, but will not die. This is to be differenciated with the 
    "god"-command, which just makes you invincible.
  </p>
  <p class="thing2">noclip: This command gives you the ability to fly through walls and props without collision.</p>
  <p class="thing2">sv_portal_placement_never_fail: This command gives you the ability to shoot portals even at black walls or similar
    surfaces.
  </p>
  <p class="thing2">impulse 101: This command gives you the Half-Life 2 weapons. Bizarre Information: Not only is Portal made in the same
    engine as Half-Life and Half-Life 2, but Portal and Portal 2 are actually MODS of their respective Half-Life counterparts. This makes
    you able to get things like the gravity gun in Portal to try and play through the game with it.
  </p>
  <p class="thing2">sv_cheats 1: This command enables cheats, which makes it possible to use all of the above commands! (Not possible
    if this isn't turned on.)
