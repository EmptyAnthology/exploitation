  <p class="thing2">The Wormhole is probably one of the most infamous and known exploits of Minecraft history simply due
    to how it was introduced to the public. The exploit was first recorded/found by SilicatTV, which makes it possible to
    get fly, spectator mode and certain cheats in survival minecraft on multiplayer. This, however, had limitations. It was impossible
    to get creative, op, or items. The players Vitalasy, ItzSubz, ashswagg and SpokeIsHere from popular YouTube SMP Lifesteal wanted
    to crush those limits though and managed to do so through psychological play, managing to trick the owner into giving them creative.
    Now, I won't pretend to know how this exploit works, but it has to do with "shadow servers" and something like that.
    Watch Silicat's and Spoke's videos on the manner which will be linked in the sources. All of these events are recorded in
    the over thirty videos by Spoke documenting the Wormhole series which, at this point in time (January of 2024)
    has amassed over 28 million views including YouTube Shorts. This video series resulted in two things: first,
    the Wormhole Exploit was finally patched by Mojang and second, it blew fresh life into the dwindling Community of
    Minecraft players attracted by the Illegal, including little old me. Before this, Exploiting was viewed as either
    something only sweaty nerds or mean hackers do, but now, the Exploiting Community had gotten fresh wind blown into it.
    In that sense, SpokeIsHere was some sort of messiah for the Exploting Community.</p class="thing2">
<p class="thing2">But what exactly is the Wormhole? In my thoughts, it stands for three things. First,
    the wormhole represents Illegal Items. These are items that have properties to them that cannot be created or achieved
    in no-cheats survival. One might think of this as items that simply have the sharpness enchantment of the level 255,
    and, said simply, one would be correct. But those items are made by people often new to the Exploiting Community.
    A common advancement to those items are so-called "kits". These are containers, often shulker boxes, containing items
    that are more sophisticated, have more thought put into them and are generally connected by some sort of theme. Examples
    for this would be the Infinity Kit or the Cuties Kit. There are, however, also other kits which often contain items
    that grant powers only available with using actual commands. The best example of this would be the "Abuse Kit" which
    contains pre-written books that execute commands that, as an example, can mask command block output.
    But these kits can also contain other items like bombs, pre-filled respawn anchors or op mobs that fight for you.</p class="thing2">
<p class="thing2">Second, the Wormhole represents exploits that fundamentally break the game. People have long been 
    searching for a way to obtain creative mode on no-cheat survival mode server, but there weren't any ever since
    Mojang patched Cracked Minecraft Launcher which were able to give you signs and commands blocks with pre-filled commands.
    Many had thought that such a glitch just didn't exist. The glitch Spoke used was known in Minecraft Sub-communities for 
    a long time with the most famous mention coming from the YouTuber "TheMisterEpic". But everyone thought the exploit to be useless,
    and still, Spoke managed to abuse it. This in itself is a mighty achievement and, to me, sort of represents how inspiring
    this can be. This, to me, proves that there still is a glitch like this out there. It won't be easy to find, but it
    exists.</p class="thing2">
<p class="thing2">So, what is the third? Well, to me, the Wormhole also is a way of thinking. Seeking to advance your power and 
    knowledge of exploiting in any way for whatever reason. You get invested in researching and upgrading your knowledge to find out 
    how you can get more and more power, get closer and closer to obtaining the ideal wormhole, a barrel contaning items
    that cannot be defeated, a glitch that cannot be patched. I, for myself, have embraced this way of thinking of encourage
    everyone else to do so. For my, only good came of it.</p class="thing2">
