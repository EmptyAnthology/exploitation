  <h1>EmptyAnthology's Exploiting Website: The fascinating story of The RootHouse</h1>
  </center>
  <br>
  
  <p class="thing2">At this point, it feels kinda weird talking about something Minecraft-related that isn't Exploiting or PVP, because
    to me, those are the two main aspects of Minecraft that matter in my life, but it seems like for a time way to long, I haven't told
    any STORIES in Minecraft aside from petty roleplay on BanBan SMP (once again, read the wormhole diary), which is a bummer because
    Minecraft is the perfect sandbox to host and tell stories like these. Case and point, the RootHouse. 
  </p>
  <p class="thing2">The RootHouse is an original series by incredibly talented creator Zeemyth. While on the surface,
    it does just look like a try to clickbait stupid children with the backrooms for views, but if I'm completely honest, THIS interpretation
    of the backrooms/liminal spaces might be the best I've ever seen, period. Upon opening the playlist, the description reads:
  </p>
  <p class="thing2">
    "What happens when a HHouse grows sick?
    [A dictation of Events in order]"
  </p>
  <p class="thing2">This completely mysterious sentence is completely mysterious. The last upload of the series is seven months old with
    it being "Going Deeper Into the Rotting Backrooms... [Day 13]". The uploads of the series are not linear at all, with the video 
    that is the latest in the timeline ("I'm trapped in an INFINITE PRISON in Minecraft Backrooms") being uploaded before the 
    first in the series, "Why I went PAST the FARLANDS in Minecraft".
  </p>
  <p class="thing2">
    In the series, we follow c!Zeemyth. Well, MULTIPLE Zeemyths, but we'll get into that. From what I can tell, this series has 4 different
    connected seperate story lines which I've creatively dubbed "The Farlands", "The Rotting Backrooms", "The Rooted Backrooms" and 
    "The Infinite House". I'll dissect each of them now.
  </p>
  <p class="thing2">
    The Farlands: This Story-Arc is composed of only one video ("Why I went PAST the Farlands in Minecraft") and also the newest addition 
    with it being the only one that doesn't feature a liminal space like the backrooms. Of all the arcs, it is the most disconnected
    of the overall story of The RootHouse. We follow a character I'll call the First Zeemyth as he is the first Zeemyth that we meet. 
    This Zeemyth does what he advertises: he wants to reach the FINAL stage of the Farlands, the Fringe. While crossing the first 8 regions,
    he finds four notable events: he sees a shadowy figure with two white eyes, a group of tall dark figures shambling near 
    a path that approach him aggressively but then disappear, he finds a music box with the disc "Far" in it and he finds a house that
    is bigger on the inside than on the outside; specifically, infinitely tall. But for unknwown reasons, when he gets scared, he jumps
    outside just to find that the didn't ascend the house at all. And then, the house falls over and disappears. After that, Zeemyth dies 
    and gets send to the eight area of the farlands. In there, he has creative and then, he enters the final area, the fringe. Many 
    torches are placed there implying that many people before this iteration of Zeemyth (once again, we'll get into that) were there.
    Then, a gigantic creature opens it's white glowing eyes and the video glitches. Then
